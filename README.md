# Ola_DataAnalysis_Dashboard
Managing ride bookings, cancellations, revenue, and customer satisfaction is a complex challenge for ride-hailing companies like OLA. To drive data-driven decisions, I built a Power BI dashboard that uncovers key insights into ride volume, revenue trends, vehicle performance, and customer ratings.

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze OLA's ride data to provide meaningful insights on ride volume, revenue, cancellations, and customer satisfaction. This helps in improving operations, optimizing pricing strategies, and enhancing the customer experience.

## Dataset Used
- Historical ride data (including ride volume, customer ratings, booking status, payment methods, and cancellations)
- Data sources were pre-processed and cleaned for accurate analysis

## Key Questions (KPIs) Answered
- Ride Volume Over Time – How does ride demand fluctuate daily/weekly?
- Booking Status Breakdown – What percentage of rides are completed vs. canceled?
- Top 5 Vehicle Types by Ride Distance – Which vehicles cover the most distance?
- Revenue by Payment Method – What is the revenue split across Cash, UPI, and Cards?
- Top 5 Customers by Total Booking Value – Who are the highest-spending customers?
- Ride Distance Distribution Per Day – What are the trends in ride distances?
- Cancelled Ride Reasons (Customers & Drivers) – Why are rides being canceled?
- Driver & Customer Ratings Analysis – How do ratings vary across rides and vehicle types?

## Process
- Data Cleaning & Validation – Checked for missing values, inconsistencies, and anomalies
- Data Modeling – Established relationships for optimized querying
- DAX Calculations – Created measures & calculated fields for deeper insights
- Pivot Tables & Charts – Designed interactive visualizations in Power BI
- Dashboard Development – Combined all reports into a dynamic, user-friendly dashboard

## Project Insights
- Ride Demand Trends – Peak ride bookings observed in certain months
- Customer Behavior – Certain demographics prefer specific vehicle types
- Cancellation Analysis – Customers and drivers cancel rides for different reasons
- Revenue Trends – Digital payments (UPI, Cards) contribute significantly to earnings
- Ratings Impact – Driver and customer ratings affect ride completions and loyalty

## Final Conclusion
To enhance OLA's operations, a data-driven strategy should be adopted, focusing on:
- Reducing ride cancellations by addressing key customer/driver concerns
- Optimizing vehicle allocation to maximize ride efficiency
- Targeted promotions for high-value customers and frequent riders
- Encouraging digital payments for seamless transactions

This dashboard provides actionable insights that help OLA make smarter business decisions and improve overall ride experiences.
